# RegexGolfMobile

Inspired by the website:
https://regexone.com/ 

Regex Golf Mobile is an andoid app that pits users against eachother on their 
phones to see who can solve various regular expressions the fastest. 

There can be different topics for regular expressions like:
- Normal English language
- HTML tag extraction
- Filesystem parsing
- ...

The idea is two users begin a challenge where they are given a regular expression
problem, and they must solve this problem as quickly as possible. The winner gets
a point.

A special keyboard containing all the necessary keys would be useful. Like a key
for: "[a-z]" for example.
